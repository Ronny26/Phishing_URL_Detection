# Phishing_URL_Detection
This commit introduces the Jupyter notebook `computeHeavyDetection.py`, containing the complete code for our phishing URL detection project. The notebook outlines the process from data loading and preprocessing, feature extraction, model training with BERT, to evaluation with various metrics. Due to computational limits, training was capped at 3 epochs, which we plan to extend in future work with more resources.
